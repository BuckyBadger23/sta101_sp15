\begin{itemize}

\item No new PS this week, but review questions provided on new material that will be on the exam next week

\item Sample midterm + review questions posted

\item PA3 will be posted on Monday after class and will be due that evening, so budget your time accordingly for that short turnaround!

\frametitle{Common misconceptions about confidence intervals}

\begin{enumerate}

\item \textcolor{gray}{The confidence level of a confidence interval is the probability that a given interval contains the true population parameter.} \\
\textit{This is incorrect, CIs are part of the frequentist paradigm and as such the population parameter is fixed but unknown. Consequently, the probability any given CI contains the true value must be 0 or 1 (it does or does not).} \\
$\:$ \\

\pause

\item  \textcolor{gray}{A narrower confidence interval is always better.}\\
\textit{This is incorrect since the width is a function of both the confidence level and the standard error.} \\
$\:$ \\

\pause

\item   \textcolor{gray}{A wider interval means less confidence.} \\
\textit{This is incorrect since it is possible to make very precise statements with very little confidence.} \\

\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item The probability that average GPA of Duke students has changed since 2001.

\item The probability that average GPA of Duke students has not changed since 2001, if in fact a random sample of 63 Duke students this year have an average GPA of 3.58 or higher.

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Common misconceptions about hypothesis testing}

\begin{enumerate}

\item \textcolor{gray}{P-value is the probability that the null hypothesis is true} \\
\textit{This is incorrect, p-value is the probability of the observed or more extreme outcome if in fact the null hypothesis is correct. It is the conditional probability of the observed data (or something more extreme), conditioned on the null hypothesis being correct.} \\
$\:$ \\

\pause

\item  \textcolor{gray}{A high p-value confirms the null hypothesis.}\\
\textit{This is incorrect, a high p-value means the data do not provide convincing evidence for the alternative hypothesis and hence that the null hypothesis can't be rejected.} \\
$\:$ \\

\pause

\item   \textcolor{gray}{A low p-value confirms the alternative hypothesis.} \\
\textit{This is incorrect, a low p-value means the data provide convincing evidence for the alternative hypothesis, but not necessarily that it is confirmed.} \\

\frametitle{Recap: Hypothesis testing framework}

\begin{enumerate}

\item Set the hypotheses.

\item Check assumptions and conditions.

\item Calculate a \hl{test statistic} and a p-value.

\item Make a decision, and interpret it in context of the research question.

\frametitle{Recap: Hypothesis testing for a population mean}

\begin{enumerate}

\item Set the hypotheses
\begin{itemize}
\item $H_0: \mu = null~value$
\item $H_A: \mu <$ or $>$ or $\ne null~value$
\end{itemize}

\item Check assumptions and conditions
\begin{itemize}
\item Independence: random sample/assignment, 10\% condition when sampling without replacement
\item Normality: nearly normal population or $n \ge 30$, no extreme skew
\end{itemize}

\item Calculate a \hl{test statistic} and a p-value (draw a picture!)
\[ Z = \frac{\bar{x} - \mu}{SE},~where~SE = \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}} \]

\item Make a decision, and interpret it in context of the research question
\begin{itemize}
\item If p-value $< \alpha$, reject $H_0$, data provide evidence for $H_A$
\item If p-value $> \alpha$, do not reject $H_0$, data do not provide evidence for $H_A$
