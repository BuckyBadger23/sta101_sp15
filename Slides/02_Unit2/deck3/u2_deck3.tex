\subsection{Two types of probability distributions: discrete and continuous}
\label{mi1}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{1. Two types of probability distributions: discrete and continuous}

\begin{itemize}

\item A \hl{discrete probability distribution} lists all possible events and the probabilities with which they occur
\begin{itemize}
\item The events listed must be disjoint
\item Each probability must be between 0 and 1 
\item The probabilities must total 1
\end{itemize}

\pause

\item A \hl{continuous probability distribution} differs from a discrete probability distribution in several ways:
\begin{itemize}
\item The probability that a continuous random variable will equal to any specific value is zero.
\item As such, they cannot be expressed in tabular form.
\item Instead, we use an equation or a formula to describe its distribution via a probability density function (pdf).
\item We can calculate the probability for ranges of values the random variable takes (area under the curve).
\end{itemize}

\end{itemize}

\pause

\begin{itemize}

\item Unimodal and symmetric (bell shaped) that follows very strict guidelines about how variably the data are distributed around the mean \\

\pause

\item \hl{68-95-99.7 Rule:}
\begin{itemize}
\item about 68\% of the distribution falls within 1 SD of the mean
\item about 95\% falls within 2 SD of the mean
\item about 99.7\% falls within 3 SD of the mean
\item it is possible for observations to fall 4, 5, or more standard deviations away from the mean, but this is very rare if the data are nearly normal
\end{itemize}

\pause

\item While most variables are nearly normal, but none are exactly normal

\subsection{Z scores serve as a ruler for any distribution}
\label{mi3}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{3. Z scores serve as a ruler for any distribution}

\[ Z = \frac{obs - mean}{SD} \]

\begin{itemize}

\item Z score: number of standard deviations it falls above or below the mean

\pause

\item Defined for distributions of any shape, but only when the distribution is normal can we use Z scores to calculate percentiles

\pause

\item Observations with $|Z| > 2$ are usually considered \hl{unusual}

\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsection{Z distribution is normal with $\mu = 0$ and $\sigma = 1$}
\label{mi4}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{4. Z distribution is normal with $\mu = 0$ and $\sigma = 1$}

\begin{itemize}

\item Linear transformations of normally distributed random variable will also be normally distributed.

\item Hence, if

\[ Z = \frac{X - \mu}{\sigma}, \text{ where } X \sim N(\mu, \sigma), \]

then

\[ Z \sim N(0,1) \]

\item Z distribution is a special case of the normal distribution where $\mu = 0$ and $\sigma = 1$ (unit normal distribution)

\item The mean of the standardized Z-scores will equal 100.
\item The mean of the standardized Z-scores will equal 5.

\item \solnMult{In a normal distribution, Q1 and Q3 are more than one SD away from the mean.}
\item Regardless of the shape of the distribution (symmetric vs. skewed) the Z score of the mean is always 0.

\subsection{Normally distributed data plot as a straight line on the normal probability plot}
\label{mi5}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Anatomy of a normal probability plot}

\begin{itemize}

\item Data are plotted on the y-axis of a normal probability plot, and theoretical quantiles (following a normal distribution) on the x-axis

\pause

\item If there is a one-to-one relationship between the data and the theoretical quantiles, then the data follow a nearly normal distribution

\pause

\item Since a one-to-one relationship would appear as a straight line on a scatter plot, the closer the points are to a perfect straight line, the more confident we can be that the data follow the normal model

\pause

\item Constructing a normal probability plot requires calculating percentiles and corresponding Z-scores for each observation, which is tedious. Therefore we generally rely on software when making these plots

\end{itemize}

\item Order the observations.

\item Determine the percentile of each observation in the ordered data set.

\item Identify the Z score corresponding to each percentile.

\item Create a scatterplot of the observations (vertical) against the Z scores (horizontal)

\end{enumerate}
