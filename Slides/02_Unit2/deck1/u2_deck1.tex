\item $P(A~and~B) = P(A) \times P(B)$
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\end{itemize}

%---Note---
\note{

\begin{outline}
\1  3 main ideas

\2 First idea: disjoint and independent do not mean the same thing.

\end{outline}

Let's look at the definitions of disjoint and independent.

\textbf{Disjoint}:

\begin{outline}

\1 Disjoint events are events that cannot happen at the same time.

\1 Disjoint events are also called \textbf{mutually exclusive}.

\1 If disjoint events cannot happen at the same time, the probability that both
occur is zero.

\1 Suppose I consider the population of US voters.

\2 In this setup the cases of interest are people.

\1 Now suppose I reached into this population and randomly sampled a person.

\1 One event: This person is a Democrat.

\2 And then I could ask, what is the probability of this event, and as we saw
last time, this would be the proportion of voters that are registered as Democrats.

\1 Another event: This person is a Republican.

\2 And I could also ask, what is the probability of this event.  And this would
also relate back to proportions.

\1 But these two events are mutually exclusive.  You can't be a registered
Democrate and a registered Republican at the same time.  So the probability that
the person is a Democrate and a Republican is zero.

\1 Let's consider yet another event: This person is a moderate.

\2 It is totally possible that a person is both a Republican and a moderate.  So
these two events are not disjoint.

\2 Disjointness is all about if two events can occur simultaneously.

\end{outline}

\textbf{Independence}

\begin{outline}

\1 independence has to do with one event informing another.

\1 What is the probability that I roll a 1,2,3? 1/2

\1 What is the probability that I roll a 1? 1/6

\1 Now, what if I roll this die, but don't show you what landed up.  I just say
that I rolled a 1,2,3, what is the probability that I rolled a 1? 1/3

\1 So if I don't know anything, then the probability is 1/6, but if I know that
the roll resulted in a 1,2,3, then that tells me something about the probability
of having rolled a 1.

\1 independent: two events are independent if having information on one doesn't
tell us anything about the other.

\2 ASK: can anyone think of two events that are obviously independent of each
other.  any examples?

\3 two coins example.  Bring up if they don't say.

\3 Go through conditional notation using coin example.

\subsection{Application of the addition rule depends on disjointness of events}

\frametitle{2. Application of the addition rule depends on disjointness of events}

\begin{itemize}

\item \hl{General addition rule:} P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B)

\item A or B = either A or B or both

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width = 0.9\textwidth]{figures/venn/venn_non_disjoint}
\end{center}
}

%---Note---
\note{

\begin{outline}

\1 This is the general addition rule.

\1 We need to watch out for this because this may be slightly different than how
we use the word OR in English.

For instance, I might ask, do you want to go to a movie or a play on Friday
night.  What I mean when I ask that is do you want to go to either a movie or a
play, but not both.

But the definition of OR always includes the possibility of both events
occuring.  

\textbf{Does either A occur or B occur or both.}

\1 It is possible to visualize the general addition rule.  

\2 When two events are disjoint we draw two blobs that don't overlap to indicate
that they are mutually exclusive and write the probability of each occuring
within the blob.

\2 When two events are not disjoint, we draw two blobs that do overlap to
indicate that it is possible for both events to occur.

The probability of A is still 0.4, the probability of B is still 0.3.  If we
just add 0.4 to 0.3 we double count the overlaps of the two events.  But we just
want to single count it.  So we need to subtract the amount that is in the
intersection.

\end{itemize}
}

%---Note---
\note{

\begin{outline}

\1 First, a bit about terminology.

\2 This is a conditional distribution because we are asking what is the
probability that A occurs given that we know B occurs.

\2 This is a joint probability, it is asking what is the probability that BOTH A
and B jointly occur.

\2 And this a a marginal probability, it is asking what is the probability that
B occurs, without reference to A.

\2 So the probability of A knowing B is the probability of A and B occuring
divided by the probability of B occuring.

\1 We can rewrite this as...

\1 Let's see how this relates back to disjoint and independent sets.

\1 What if A and B are disjoint:

\2 Say a family member is about to have a baby and the A represents the event of
having a girl while B represent the event of having a boy.

\2 Then the probability of having a girl given that the baby is a boy is zero.

\2 We can relate this back to what we said earlier, what is the probability that
the baby is a boy and the baby is a girl?

\1 What if A and B are independent?

\1 This is like what we said earlier.  Suppose a I roll a die twice.  What I get
on the first roll doesn't affect the second roll.  So the probability of rolling
a 4 on the second roll and a 1 on the first roll is just the probability of
rolling a 4 on the second roll times rolling a 1 on the first roll.
