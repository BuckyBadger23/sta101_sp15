\label{mi1}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{1. Disjoint and independent does not mean the same thing}

\begin{itemize}

\item \hl{Disjoint (mutually exclusive) outcomes} cannot happen at the same time
\begin{itemize}
\item A voter cannot register as a Democrat and a Republican at the same time
\item But s/he might be a Republican and a Moderate at the same time -- \hl{non-disjoint outcomes}
\item For disjoint A and B: $P(A~and~B) = 0$
\end{itemize}

\pause

\item If A and B are \hl{Independent events}, having information on A does not tell us anything about B (and vice versa)
\begin{itemize}
\item If A and B are independent: 
\begin{itemize}
\item $P(A~|~B) = P(A)$
\item $P(A~and~B) = P(A) \times P(B)$
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{2. Bayes' theorem works for all types of events}

\begin{itemize}

\item \hl{Bayes' theorem:} $P(A~|~B) = \frac{P(A~and~B)}{P(B)}$

\pause

\item ... can be rewritten as: $P(A~and~B) = P(A~|~B) \times P(B)$

\end{itemize}

\pause

\textbf{For disjoint outcomes:}

\begin{itemize}
\item We know $P(A~|~B) = 0$, since if B happened A could not have happened
\item Then, $P(A~and~B) = P(A~|~B) \times P(B) = \red{0} \times P(B) = 0$
\end{itemize}

\textbf{For independent events:}

\begin{itemize}
\item We know $P(A~|~B) = P(A)$, since knowing B doesn't tell us anything about A
\item Then, $P(A~and~B) = P(A~|~B) \times P(B) = \red{P(A)} \times P(B)$
