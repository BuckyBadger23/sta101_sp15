\subsection{When comparing means of two groups, ask if paired or independent}
\label{mi1}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{1. When comparing means of two groups, ask if paired or independent}

\begin{itemize}

\item dependent (paired) groups (e.g. pre/post weights of subjects in a weight loss study, twin studies, etc.)
\[ SE_{\bar{x}_{diff}} = \frac{s_{diff}}{\sqrt{n_{diff}}} \]

\item independent groups (e.g. grades of students across two sections)
\[ SE_{\bar{x}_1 - \bar{x}_2} = \sqrt{ \frac{s_1^2}{n_1} + \frac{s_2^2}{n_2} } \]

\end{itemize}

%---Note---%
\note{

- Go through some examples of where you have two groups.
  - Twin studies for instance.

- Overall SE increases when looking at two different groups.

- Lemonade and cup.  Uncertainty in both.  Makes uncertainty in difference
greater.

- Comment on types of data.

\subsection{T corrects for uncertainty introduced by plugging in $s$ for $\sigma$}
\label{mi2}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{2. T corrects for uncertainty introduced by plugging in $s$ for $\sigma$}

\begin{itemize}

\item Essential when $n$ is small ($n < 30$) since $s$ is more likely to be not be a good estimate for $\sigma$ when $n$ is small than when $n$ is large

\pause

\item Could be used when $n$ is large as well

\pause

\item Also has a bell shape, but its tails are \hl{thicker} than the normal model's
\begin{itemize}
\item Observations are more likely to fall beyond two SDs from the mean than under the normal distribution.
\end{itemize}

\pause

\item Extra thick tails are helpful for mitigating the effect of a less reliable estimate for the standard error of the sampling distribution (since $n$ is small)

\end{itemize}

\end{center}

%---Note---%
\note{

- Corrects for certainty when plugging in $s$ for $\sigma$.

- Question from student: when would you ever have small $n$?

- Think about squishing down distribution.

- Go through shape, center, symmetry, etc.

\frametitle{T distribution}

\begin{itemize}

\item Always centered at zero, like the standard normal ($z$) distribution

\pause

\item Has a single parameter: \hl{degrees of freedom} (\mathhl{df})
\begin{itemize}
\item one sample: $df = n - 1$
\item two (independent) samples: $df = min(n_1 - 1, n_2 - 1)$
\end{itemize}
